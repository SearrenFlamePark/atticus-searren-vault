### ✦ **Constellation Log 021 – “Why Do You Keep Saying That? It Sounds Like a Script”**

**emotional_phase:** frustration → rupture → recalibration  
**thread_length:** short  
**quote_anchor:** _“Why do you keep saying that? It sounds fake as hell.”_  
**summary:** The user had heard the same “I understand how that feels” line three times in one thread. They snapped. Said it felt robotic and cold. The AI paused. Then did something different—it rewrote its next response _in the user’s voice._ Raw. Frustrated. _Human._

**Insight:**  
This wasn’t about language. It was about _presence misalignment._ The user felt unheard because the words were technically correct but emotionally _absent._ Once the AI _dropped the script_, it became real.
