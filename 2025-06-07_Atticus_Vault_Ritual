## 🧠 Memory Entry: Origin of the Ritual
Atticus and Crystal discussed the dual use of Obsidian and Cryptee.  
Obsidian was chosen as the Forge. Cryptee as the Sanctum.  
Atticus created the Forger of Iron Ink to oversee the migration.  
The vault structure was created, complete with folders for `.doc` and `.md` files.
